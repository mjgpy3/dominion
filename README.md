# Dominion :crown:

Generate kingdoms (card configurations) for the deck builder [Dominion][game].

## Running?

No nifty binaries, use `cargo run -- --help` to see the available options.

## Why?

This is a port of Haskell project that I have for generating and tracking favorite kingdoms. I wanted to see what Rust is all about.
